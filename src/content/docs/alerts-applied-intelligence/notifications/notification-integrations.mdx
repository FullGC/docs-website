  ## Permissions [#jira-permissions]

  The required permissions from the Jira `API-Token` are:
  `BROWSE_PROJECTS`, `ASSIGN_ISSUES`, `CLOSE_ISSUES`, `CREATE_ISSUES`, `EDIT_ISSUES`, `RESOLVE_ISSUES`, `TRANSITION_ISSUES`, `USER_PICKER`, `ADD_COMMENTS`, 

  To enable the two-way sync toggle, the provided Jira `API-Key` should have an `Admin` role.

  ## Set up a Jira destination [#set-up-jira]

  Create Jira issues, then enable Jira and New Relic to share updates and stay synced.

  To create a Jira destination, enter the following information:
  * **Destination name:** Custom name to identify the destination.
  * **Jira account endpoint:** The URL of the destination.
  * **User-name:** The email address of the user.
  * **API token:** generated from your Atlassian account.

  <Callout variant="important">
    New Relic currently supports [Atlassian-Jira Classic (company-managed) projects](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-software-cloud/docs/what-are-team-managed-and-company-managed-projects/). 
  </Callout>

  Before saving the destination, we recommend you test the connection via the **Test connection** button.

### Two-way sync [#jira-two-way]
To enable two-way sync, turn on the ‘two-way integration’ toggle. 
When turned on, a [Jira Webhook](https://developer.atlassian.com/server/jira/platform/webhooks/) is created in your Jira account at a later stage for the selected project. The webhook contains access details to New Relic (URL and API key).

Two-way sync is applicable for New Relic Workflows

#### Sync with NewRelic Workflows[#two-way-sync-workflows]
- Closure of New Relic Issue is triggered when the JIRA issue status changes to done.
- Acknowledgment of New Relic Issue is triggered when the JIRA issue status changes to in-progress.

## Configure the message template [#configure-jira-message-template]

To configure a template for a Jira issue: 

1. Choose a destination. You can create a new destination at this stage. 
2. Upon successful connection to the destination, choose a project, and then select the Jira issue type you would like to be used. 
3. Once the issue-type is selected, the configured project's fields are fetched from your account and automatically mapped to your Jira instance. 

To help you get started, we automatically populate the required and recommended fields and values. Required fields must be set with a value. You can add or remove optional fields using the `X` mark on their right side.

  id="6or6n8am4k"
  />    

  ## Roles [#roles-servicenow]

  As part of the integrations, we fetch fields from the your ServiceNow incident table, and other optional values. We require the following permissions:

  * Read permissions for the tables `sys_dictionary`, `sys_choice`, `sys_user`, and `task`. 
  * Read/write permission to `incident`.
  * To fetch users for the `caller` column, we need read permissions for the `sys_user` table.

  The roles `personalize_choices`, `personalize_dictionary`, `rest_service`, and `itil` have the above permissions. 

  Read/Write permissions to the `api_key_credentials` table is required to enable two-way integration. The roles `credentials_admin` and `discovery_admin` provide these. 

  ## Set up a destination [#set-up-service-destination]

  To create a ServiceNow destination, enter the following information:

  * **Destination Name:** Custom name to identify the destination.
  * **Domain:** The URL of the destination.
  * **User-name:** The name of the user.
  * **Password:** The user's password. 

  Before saving the destination, we recommend testing the connection by clicking the **Test connection** button.

  ![A screenshot of a ServiceNow destination configuration.](./images/serviceNow_destination.png "ServiceNow destination configuration.")

  ### Two-way sync [#two-way-snow]

  To configure the two-way integration:

  1. Turn on the `two-way integration` toggle. 

  2. Open and download this <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/newrelic-notifications/snow-two-way-sync/Newrelic-Snow-Sync-Configurations.xml" download="NewRelic-SNow-Sync-Configurations.xml">XML file</a>, which includes the business rule triggering events back to New Relic One.

  3. In the ServiceNow sidebar menu, go to **System Definition > Business Rules**.

  4. Click the menu icon in one of the column headers, select **Import XML** and upload the XML file you downloaded.

  Once the destination is saved, a New Relic API-Key will be kept in the `api_key_credentials`. The key would sent in a header as part of the callback REST call to New Relic.

  #### Sync with NewRelic Workflows[#two-way-sync-snow-workflows]
  - Closure of New Relic Issue is triggered when the ServicNow incident state changes to resolved.
  - Acknowledgment of New Relic Issue is triggered when the Servicnow incident state changes from open.

  ## Configure the message template [#configure-servicenow-message-template]

  Upon a successful connection, ServiceNow incident table columns are fetched from your account and automatically mapped to your ServiceNow instance. 

  To help you get started, we automatically populate the required and recommended fields and values. Required fields must be set with a value. You can add or remove optional fields using the `X` mark on their right side.

  ![A screenshot of some recommended ServiceNow-incident fields and values.](./images/serviceNow_message-template.png "ServiceNow incident template.")

  <figcaption>Select, edit or remove fields for the ServiceNow-Incident template.</figcaption>

  ## Send a test notification [#send-servicenow-test]

  Click on **Test notification** to see ServiceNow incidents with default field values. If successful, an incident will be created, and a link will appear.

  **Send notification messages to your Slack channels.**

  <Video
    type="wistia"
    id="3ypdkpd7zg"
  />      

  ## Prerequisites [#slack-prereqs]

  Your Slack workspace needs to have the [New Relic application](https://newrelic.slack.com/apps/AP92KQJS3-new-relic?tab=more_info) installed. The application must be approved by a workspace admin before it can be individually installed by users.

  ## Set up a Slack destination [#set-slack-destination]

  Click **one-click Slack authentication** to go to the Slack landing page, and continue the OAuth2 authentication process. If you're not signed into the required workspace, you're redirected to Slack to sign in.
  
  ![A screenshot of the one-click Slack authentication.](./images/slack_destination-authentication.png "Create a Slack destination with a click.")

  Add your workspace name or select the relevant workspace, and click **Continue**.
  
  ![add a workspace.](./images/slack-sign-in.png "add a slack workspace.")

  When signed in to the selected workspace, allow New Relic to perform the specified actions.
  
  ![A screenshot permissions configurations.](./images/slack_destination_allow_access.png "select a workspace and configure permissions.")

  Click **Allow**, and return to the destination page.

  ![A screenshot completed authentication.](./images/slack_authentication_completed.png "authentication completed successfully.")

  ## Configure the Slack message settings [#configure-slack-message-settings]

  Select a destination (Workspace) and a slack channel where the messages will be sent. You can create a new destination if there is no pre-defined destination for the required workspace. Note that, for privacy reasons, users need to be authenticated once to select private channels.

  ![Slack settings, user is not authenticated.](./images/slack_message-template-user-not-authenticated.png "Authenticate to select private channels.")

  ### Send a test notification [#send-slack-test]

  You can send a test notification with a pre-defined example payload to the channel. This creates a message in the selected slack channel.

  <Video
    type="wistia"
    id="feyutwgew8"
  />       
      
  ## Set up a webhook destination [#set-webhook-destination]

  To create a webhook destination, you need the following:

  * **Destination Name:** A unique destination name.
  * **URL:** The endpoint of the target application, authentication and custom headers if needed.
  * **Authorization mechanism (*Optional*):**. Can be `basic authentication` or a `bearer token`.

  ## Configure the webhook event template [#configure-webhook-event-template]

  Pick a webhook destination from the list, and configure the `HTTP-POST` request. 

  The request configuration requires you to:

  1. Set a name for the template.
  2. Select a pre-configured destination from the destinations list or create a new one.
  3. Add custom headers (optional).
  4. Configure the request's payload.

  ## Customize the webhook payload [#customize-webhook-payload]

  You can use the default payload or customize it to contain the required data. Pick variables from the [variables menu](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/notifications/message-templates/#variables-menu) and apply [handlebars syntax](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/notifications/message-templates/#handlebars-syntax) to enrich your webhook.

  Note that the request's content-type is JSON by default. Hence, the payload needs to be a JSON. See [Usage examples](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/notifications/message-templates/#usage-examples). 

  The **Preview** section on the right hand-side shows an expected payload after the template is rendered. If the payload doesn't form a valid JSON, an error will be shown and it won't be possible to save the template. 

  ![A screenshot of an invalid Json payload.](./images/webhook-preview-error.png "An invalid Json payload.")

  If the webhook payload conforms to a valid JSON, you can send a test notification to your defined webhook destination. 

  ![A screenshot of a test webhook notification template.](./images/webhook-notification-template.png "A test webhook notification template.")

  We recommend sending a test notification to make sure that everything's connected correctly.

  **Send email notifications to users**

  ## Set up an email destination [#set-email-destination]
  You don't need to create email destinations manually. These destinations are created automaticlly when a workflow is activated or updated. 
      
  ## Configure the email settings [#configure-email-settings]

  Add one or more recipients. 
  
  * Users with New Relic accounts can be found via autocomplete when searching for their name or email address.
  * To add a user without a New Relic account or email distribution list, enter their full email address.

  Every recipient will be translated into a destination. You can follow the email notifications per destination in the [notifications-log](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/notifications/destinations/#notifications-log).

  ![A screenshot of the email settings.](./images/email_settings.png "Email settings")

  ### Send a test notification [#email-test]

  Send a test notification to make sure the email notifications reach the inbox.

  >

**Newrelic makes it easy to hook New Relic events into AWS services with [AWS EventBridge](https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/), Amazon's serverless event bus.  
Use EventBridge to deliver notification messages that route the data to targets like AWS Lambda, SNS queue, CloudWatch log and so forth.**

## Set up a destination [#set-up-eventbridge]

To create an EventBridge destination, go to the integration method tab and enter the following information:

*  **Name**: The Destination name.
*  **AWS Region**: Select the service where the event-source would be created.
*  **AWS Region**: Your AWS account ID.

  ![A screenshot of an EventBridge destination configuration.](./images/eventbridge-destination.png "EventBridge destination configuration.")

## Configure the message template [#message-eventbridge]

Follow the steps to configure an EventBridge integration:

1. **Select a destination**. You can create a new Destination at this stage.
   
    ![A screenshot of the EventBridge message template configuration - select destination.](./images/eventbridge-channel_select-destination.png "EventBridge - select destination.")

2. **Select a New Relic partner event-source**. If you wish to create a new event-source, type its name in the event-source field and press 'Enter'. Press the 'Done button' after selecting the event-source. If you have entered a new event-source name, it will be created in your AWS account.   
   
    ![A screenshot of the EventBridge message template configuration - select an event-source.](./images/eventBridge-channel_select-event-source.png "EventBridge - select an event-source.")

3. **Associate the event-source in your AWS account, and create a rule**. 
   
    ![A screenshot of the EventBridge - in AWS instructions.](./images/eventBridge-channel_guide.png "EventBridge - in AWS instructions.")

   1. **Associate the event source with an event bus**.
    Open the EventBridge service page in your AWS account. Select Integrations > Partner event sources. Select your event-source, and associate it with event bus by clicking the ‘associate with event bus’ button. This will create an event bus with the same name.

    ![A screenshot of the EventBridge - event bus association.](./images/eventBridge-channel_associate-event-source.png "EventBridge - event bus association.")
    
    1. **Create an event rule** to route the events to an AWS target. By default, the event pattern will   
     be set to get all events from the New Relic partner account. All you need to do is to select one or more targets to invoke when an event from New Relic arrives, and save the rule. 
   
    ![A screenshot of the EventBridge - rule detail.](./images/eventBridge-channel_rule_detail.png "EventBridge - rule detail.")

    ![A screenshot of the EventBridge - rule pattern.](./images/eventBridge-channel_rule_pattern.png "EventBridge - rule pattern.")

4. Back to the template configuration, **click on Done** to move to the event template configuration section.

5. **Customize the event template**.  You can use the default payload or customize it to contain the required data. Pick variables from the [variables menu](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/notifications/message-templates/#variables-menu) and apply [handlebars syntax](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/notifications/message-templates/#handlebars-syntax) to enrich your events.
   
    ![A screenshot of the EventBridge - template configuration.](./images/eventBridge-channel_event-template.png "EventBridge - template configuration.")

	Note that the request's content-type for the EventBridge API is JSON. Hence, the payload needs to be a JSON. See [Usage examples](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/notifications/message-templates/#usage-examples).

	The **Preview** section on the right-hand-side shows an expected payload after the template is rendered. If the payload doesn't form a valid JSON, an error will be shown and it won't be possible to save the template.

	If the event template conforms to a valid JSON, you can send a test notification to your defined event-source.

6. (Optional) **Send a test notification event** to make sure the event reaches the targets as expected.
7. **Save the event template**.

**Integrate New Relic with PagerDuty to automatically create, update, acknowledge and resolve PagerDuty incidents.**

  New Relic offers two ways to integrate with PagerDuty

*  **[Account level integration using REST API Keys (recommended)](#pagerduty-ali)**: The integration is fully automatic and supports two-way sync and the ability to define multiple PagerDuty services on a single New Relic destination.

*  **[Service level integration using EVENTS API keys](#pagerduty-sli)**: The single service integration uses the service level integration key, and requires a separate New Relic destination for each unique PagerDuty service.

# Account level integration [#pagerduty-ali]
The integration is fully automatic and supports two-way sync and the ability to define multiple PagerDuty services on a single New Relic destination. 

## Permissions
This integration requires permission to perform the following actions:

* [List services](https://developer.pagerduty.com/api-reference/b3A6Mjc0ODE5Ng-list-services)
* [Create an integration](https://developer.pagerduty.com/api-reference/b3A6Mjc0ODIwMw-create-a-new-integration)
* [Create a webhook subscription](https://developer.pagerduty.com/api-reference/b3A6MjkyNDc4NA-create-a-webhook-subscription)
* [Create a note](https://developer.pagerduty.com/api-reference/b3A6Mjc0ODE1MA-create-a-note-on-an-incident)
* [List teams](https://developer.pagerduty.com/api-reference/b3A6Mjc0ODIyMw-list-teams)
* [List users](https://developer.pagerduty.com/api-reference/b3A6Mjc0ODIzMw-list-users)

This integration requires a REST API Key. There are two types of REST API keys in PagerDuty:

* [General access key](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/generating-api-keys#section-generating-a-general-access-rest-api-key): It includes all the above permission and can be obtained by PagerDuty Admins and Account Owners. [See PagerDuty instructions](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/api-access-keys#generate-a-general-access-rest-api-key).

* [Personal user tokens](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/generating-api-keys#section-generating-a-personal-rest-api-key): If your account has advanced permissions, you can create unique personal REST API keys. Requests made using personal REST API keys are restricted to the user's permissions. If you choose to provide a user token API key, make sure it has the required permissions described above. [See PagerDuty instructions](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/api-access-keys#generate-a-user-token-rest-api-key).

## Set up a destination [#set-up-pagerduty]

To create a PagerDuty destination, go to the integration method tab and enter the following information:

*  **Name**: Custom name to identify the destination.

*  **API Key**: For this integration, you will be asked to provide a REST API Key.
There are two types of REST API keys in PagerDuty, [general access](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/generating-api-keys#section-generating-a-general-access-rest-api-key) and [user tokens](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/generating-api-keys#section-generating-a-personal-rest-api-key)
  
Before saving the destination, we recommend testing the connection by clicking the **Test connection** button.
  ![A screenshot of a PagerDuty account-level destination configuration.](./images/pagerDuty-account-destination.png "PagerDuty account-level destination configuration.")

### Two-way sync [#two-way-pagerduty]
To enable two-way sync, turn on the ‘two-way integration’ toggle.

When turned on, a PagerDuty subscription would be created at a later stage, for the selected PagerDuty service (see ‘customize a message template’). The webhook would contain access details to Newrelic (URL and Newrelic API-KEY)  

By default, any change of state to the PagerDuty incident created by Newrelic will sync back to Newrelic.
#### Sync with Newrelic Workflows[#two-way-sync-workflows]
- A change of state to a PagerDuty incident (acknowledged/resolved) will reflect in the NewRelic Issue

## Configure the message template [#message-pagerduty]
To configure the message template:

1. Choose a destination. You can create a new destination at this stage.
2. Select a PagerDuty service.
3. Select a user. New Relic will post notes in behalf of selected user.
* The 'custom details' value of the PagerDuty Alerts in PagerDuty is automatically populated.
  
![A screenshot of a PagerDuty account-level template configuration.](./images/pagerDuty-Account-Channel.png "PagerDuty account-level template configuration.")

### Send a test notification [#test-notification-pagerduty]
